# Introduction
We study the fluctuations around the interface formed by competitive erosion on a cylinder.
The problem was studied by xyz and some of the main results used in this article are...

## General Definition of competitive erosion on a graph


## Background for key results from the conformal map paper and limit shape theorem
### Interface for general simply connected domain is conformally invariant
#### Show the simulations here

### The interface on the cylinder domain converges quickly to a known the line
#### Show the simulations for various N

# Our main results

The correlation function for a continuous interface with interface height $$h(x)$$ at two points $$x$$ and $$x'$$ is given by
[
\begin{align*}
\Sigma(x, x') = \frac{1}{4 \pi n^2} \log( 2 - 2 \cos(x-x')).
\end{align*}
