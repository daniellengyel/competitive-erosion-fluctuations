# Introduction
We study the fluctuations around the interface formed by competitive erosion on a cylinder.
The problem was studied by xyz and some of the main results used in this article are...

## Definition  
Competitive erosion is... Represented as a MC.

Consider the following probabilistic model. Let $n$ be a positive integer. Take the cylindrical graph \$$\text{Cyl}_n$$ with vertices $$(\frac{1}{n} \Z) / \Z \times \frac{1}{n} \Z \cap [0, 1]$$, and with edges connecting adjacent lattice points, and sup

## Background for key results from the conformal map paper and limit shape theorem
Here we introduce the limit shape and conformal map results and support them with simulations.

# Our main results
Brief description of our result (could potentially be put in the introduction as well)

## Fluctuations results (Gaussian free field)
here we plot our results and do the math

#  Some more interesting/fun simulations of different domains
