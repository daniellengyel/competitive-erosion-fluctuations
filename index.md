# Our main results
We consider competitive erosion on a cylinder. We find the following correlation function for a continuous interface with interface height $$h(x)$$ at two points $$x$$ and $$x'$$ is given by
$$
\begin{align*}
\Sigma(x, x') = \frac{1}{4 \pi n^2} \log( 2 - 2 \cos(x-x')).
\end{align*}
$$

The above correlation function [ADD EQUATION LABELS] indicates that the distribution of the fluctuations can be expressed by a gaussian distribution.

To do so, we want to find the stationary distribution of the markov chain for competitive erosion on a cylinder.
In the process we will find that we can formulate this process as the Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OH) equation which is a Gaussian process, a Markov process, and is temporally homogeneous. By showing that we can formulate it as the OH equation, we can directly use the results from the OH equation's general study.
