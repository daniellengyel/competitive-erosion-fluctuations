# Introduction
We study the fluctuations around the interface formed competitive erosion on a cylinder.
The problem was studied by xyz and some of the main results used in this article are...

## Definition  
Competitive erosion is... Represented as a MC.

## Background for key results from the conformal map paper and limit shape theorem
Here we introduce the limit shape and conformal map results and support them with simulations.

# Our main results
Brief description of our result (could potentially be put in the introduction as well)
## Fluctuations results (Gaussian free field)
here we plot our results and do the math

#  Some more interesting/fun simulations of different domains
